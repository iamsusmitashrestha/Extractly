# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icons should:

1. Have a transparent background
2. Use the Exractly brand colors (purple/blue gradient)
3. Include a magnifying glass or extraction symbol
4. Be clear and recognizable at small sizes

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
2. Use online icon generators
3. Use the browser's default extension icon (will show a puzzle piece)

The extension will work without custom icons, but they improve the user experience.
